# Katacoda Demo
This is my hackup of the Katacoda example repository. 

## index.json
The file _index.json_ contains all the information about the scenario. It has the title, description and a heading for each step.

The file also contains an imageid. This refers to the Katacoda environment. Here are some environment image IDs you may find useful:

| **Environment**  | **Image ID**  |
|------------------|---------------|
| Docker           | docker        |
| Kubernetes       | kubernetes    |
| CoreOS           | coreos        |
| Node.js v6       | node6         |
| Go               | go            |
| C#               | c#            |
| Java             | java8         |
